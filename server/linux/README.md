## Server for Linux
Reads resource usage data and sends it to the arduino.

This server uses the [serial](https://github.com/wjwwood/serial) library by wjwwood to communicate with the Arduino over serial. I removed a few Windows & OSX files.  
This youtube tutorial explains using it quite well: https://youtu.be/uHw7QyL4CM8
