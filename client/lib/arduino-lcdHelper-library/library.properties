paragraph=This Arduino library aims to make your life easier when using LCD (HD44780) displays and improves support for UTF-8 chars (like ä, ö, ü, ß etc.).<br><br>It inherits all functions from your LCD library and provides additional functions, especially with UTF-8 fixes, like clearLine(), centerPrint() or movingPrint().<br>The library is made for LiquidCrystal_I2C but was mainly developed using a fork called NoiascaLiquidCrystal to support German UTF-8 chars.
